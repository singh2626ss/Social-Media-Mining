#Social Media Mining
This repository hosts the research papers and accompanying code exploring various facets of social media mining. This project encompasses data collection through Reddit's API, sentiment analysis using VADER, and topic modeling using LDA with interactive visualizations through pyLDAvis.

#Research Overview
This project comprises three main studies:

Exploring Public Sentiment on Climate Change Through Twitter Hashtags: Analysis of public opinion on climate change across different geographic regions using Twitter data.
Sentiment Analysis of Cyberbullying on Reddit: Investigating the emotional patterns of cyberbullying on Reddit through computational sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on Joe Bidenâ€™s Current Administration: Examining public sentiment and discussion topics related to President Joe Biden's administration on Reddit.
Data Collection
Data was collected using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), focusing on different aspects of social media interactions:

Twitter hashtags related to climate change.
Reddit posts regarding cyberbullying and political discussions.
#Analysis Techniques
Sentiment Analysis: Performed using the VADER sentiment analysis tool to categorize emotions into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
Topic Modeling: Conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) supported by the pyLDAvis library for interactive topic visualization.
Empath: Utilized to capture nuanced emotional distributions over time.
#Repository Structure
/papers: Contains the research papers detailing the study methodologies, results, and conclusions.
/code: Includes all scripts used for data collection, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
/datasets: Instructions on how to access or simulate the datasets used for analysis (note: actual data may not be shared due to privacy concerns).
